/*
WARNING: To use this program effectively you have to check the comments
and set the parameters apropriatelly.
You need an MQTT client like EMQTX or MQTT-Explorer 

Automatically applies the offset to the module. Be aware
that if it is not powered, and you remove the battery
all settings will be lost.

Only a ESP32x (with stable wifi) and DS3231 is needed. ESP modules with lipo socket are
greatly preferred (To avoid interruptions).
Typically after after 12-24 h the program applies an aging factor. However the program must
run again, as rarely the correction eliminates the systematic drift entirelly. After the
aging factor is applied the module will reset and start again.
After a few days the process is complete. The good news is you can have many ESP modules
running in parallel. If you have more than one running modules,
YOU NEED TO PUT A LABEL WITH THE TOIT name in every ESP module is used for this purpose.
The MQTT topic contains the IP and it is very easy with "toit scan" to find the correct
module.

Some values I found are 1.2 0.6 0.2 etc

Use the SN chips. The MEMS based are not very accurate
